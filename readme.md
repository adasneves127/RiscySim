# Riscy Simulator

## Programmed by: Alex Dasneves

### About
This repository was made for Dr. Margaret Black's Computer Archetecture course at Bridgewater State University. It's design goal was to be able to run and process RISCy Machine Code, which was designed by her to run on computers that she has designed.

This project was made in Javascript, with a user interface made in HTML and CSS.
Since it is made in Javascript, HTML, and CSS, it is able to be run on a webserver, which is the long-term plan for this.
